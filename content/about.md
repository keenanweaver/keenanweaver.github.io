## What is this?

It's a blog where you will find content regarding whatever is inspiring me at the time. But it'll probably be about gaming, Linux, or philosophy.

## Who am I?

My name is Keenan Weaver. I live in the Midwest in the United States. I've been on the internet for an unhealthily long time and have been in a lot of different gaming communities.

What I'm probably most famous for is running [Echo Sector](https://echosector.com), a fansite for the Crusader game series, which has been going since 2005.

I also ran a PC gaming website & community called Game-Central.org from 2008 to 2011 which had very mild popularity during that era of the 'PC gaming is dead' hysteria. We had a similarly successful gaming podcast in the early days of podcasts. Somehow, people still message me about how they liked our podcast back then!

I was also a contractor for [GOG.com](https://gog.com) as a product tester from 2012 to 2014. You can see my name in a few screenshots on a [couple](https://www.gog.com/en/game/wizardry_6_7) of [games](https://www.gog.com/en/game/nexus_the_jupiter_incident). Maybe that will be my real lasting legacy.

Currently, I work in IT as an infrastructure engineer.

Here are some fun facts about me:
* The first game I played online was Outlaws (1997), followed by Team Fortress Classic (1999).
* I studied computer science for the first two years of my college experience, but swapped to philosophy for the last two instead. I don't regret it!
* I'm referenced on pg. 39 of the [manual for Wing Commander: Arena](https://download.wcnews.com/files/arena/draft2cRGB.pdf) because of my obsessive Crusader fandom.
* Aside from games and tech, some other interests of mine are music, fitness, mindfulness, and golfing.
